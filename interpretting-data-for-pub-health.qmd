## Data interpretation

Data is interpreted through many phases of a project, and through many ways. Starting from the development of a research question, to collection of data, through publishing of findings.

-   Its important to consider the purpose, aims, and objects of why data is being collected.
    -   Consider where the data comes from
    -   population of interest
    -   what is the purpose

Today we will be going over the process of interpreting data for public health related fields in the domain of research.

*we will also be talking a little bit of the data science process, as this is important when it comes to interpreting data.*

# Study Design and protocol

## The "what" and "why"

Before you even interpret data, its important to understand why the research project is being conducted (or why *should* the study be funded).

:::: {style="font-size:25px"}
-   What are you interested in investigating and why is it important

    -   Ex: what are factors that contribute to achievement gaps?

    -   Ex: Do certain activities in school lead to better health outcomes?

    -   Does the use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco lead to use of other substances?

-   What is the significance of your design?

-   What does the research say about your topic?

-   It is important to be familiar with what other scientists have discovered so far.

-   Are there any gaps in the work?

    -   For ex: problem: there is a lot of data on childhood outcomes and diseases, but a lot of the research sometimes is after infection/or the disease has already progressed or already symptomatic. Solution -\> understand the social, emotional, and behavioral activities through time (longitudinal) of a youth through their childhood, adolescent, and early adult development, so what are some of the factors that may have led to these events.

## Launching a study protocol

Prior to getting your hands on the data (or interpretting it) consider the following in a research study ...

::::: panel-tabset
### sample

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
What is the largest sample size you are allotted to be able to detect any effect (power analysis)

-   Who are you recruiting (research subject)
    -   Are you working with human subjects?
    -   Animal subjects?
    -   Kids, adults, vulnerable populations?
        -   *and if for example, you are working with kids, how does school schedule play a role in participation?*
    -   Who is eligible and ineligible to participate in the study? (inclusion exclusion criteria)
        -   Ex: we are interested in investigating the association between suicidality and ADHD diagnosis, children diagnosed with tic-disorder are not eligible to participate.
        -   if you're working with human subject research, especially if it's a clinical trail for example, you should be informed and very aware of [randomization allocation.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flowchart/index.html)
:::

### recruitment site

-   If you're working with human subject research, consider who will be completing the protocol and if this is a multi-site project.

-   how many times will you be collecting this data?

-   is this supposed to be a longitudinal design or cohort study

    -   these questions are important because this will in turn, help you understand your analytical approach.
        -   *for example, if you are working with a longitudinal design, you may want to consider a model that accounts for repeated measures.*

### protocol

-   What did the interview/ data collection process look like
    -   e.g., How long does a protocol take to finish
    -   What type of data (variables) are you collecting and why
        -   For ex: the ABCD protocol is a comprehensive set of physical, cognitive and social emotional, behavioral and academic assessments in addition to a neuroimaging and biospecimen analysis done either annually or bi-annually for 10 year through the child's life.

### data

What type of data was collected. Data comes in different flavors and types. First understanding the *type* of data that was collected helps you understand how to interpret it. data can include...

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
-   Sociodemographic variables (age, income, gender, sex assigned at birth, migration status, relationship status, employment status)
-   Anthropometric data (height, weight, waist measurement?)
-   Family environment data [Family environmental Scale](https://www.mindgarden.com/96-family-environment-scale) (FES)
-   Cultural value scales [MACVS](https://elcentro.sonhs.miami.edu/research/measures-library/macvs/index.html)
-   Biological specimen (hair urine, saliva, blood, blood samples)
-   Neurocognitive tasks (RAVLT, EST NIH-TB)
-   Neuroimaging (MRI Scan)
-   Genomics (DNA, RNA)

# Study Proposal üìö

## Proposing a study for funding

-   funding is a critical part of the research process.
-   if you are working with a study that collected human subject research data, you will need to create a study proposal.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   research facilities, organizations, or companies will need to create a study proposal.

-   this is pretty much a document that outlines the aims, objectives, and methods of the study. Essentially making a claim as to why the study is important and how it will be conducted.

-   Before I get my hands on the project, if I am working with a study that collected human subject research data, I like to go over the projects protocol, and aims and goals as well as the purpose.

## What writing a study proposal entails 

::::: panel-tabset
### aims

Determine your aims

-   Ex: Determine social, behavioral, and emotional mechanisms that promote childhood well-being.
-   Ex: Address intentional injuries across lifespan to understand associated risk factors of violence and injury epidemiology.
    -   Ex: Define the parameters of Type II Diabetes that include risk factors, in order to develop an effective wellness plan.

### power

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
-   In real life, you will not be able to measure the entire K-12 population of the U.S. to determine children's social, behavioral, and emotional mechanisms. Instead, you will need to do a power sample analysis.
    -   Used to determine the adequate sample size by researchers to determine how many subjects/participants/observations are needed to answer your research question (null hypothesis) and avoid type I and Type II errors.

![](images/power.jpg){fig-align="center" width="453"}
:::

### timeline

-   how long will this study be running? for two years, three years?

-   How much time will it take to recruit participants? (recruitment and enrollment)

-   how much time will it take to collect data? (data collection)

-   how much time will it take to *clean* the data?

    -   this part takes the longest IMO!

### conclusion

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
why is this important to do? What is the significance of this?

-   Ex: what are factors that contribute to achievement gaps?

-   Ex: Do certain activities in school lead to better health outcomes?

-   Ex: Does the use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco lead to use of other substances?

    A lot of the reason human subject research is investigated is in the hopes of leading to new policies and interventions/decisions about the study population:

    -   what are factors that contribute to achievement gaps?
        -   Leads to policy decision in curricula and other programs
    -   How prevalent is traumatic brain injury (TBI) in student athletes?
        -   Assessment, education, precautions and changes in student athletics
    -   Does the use of alcohol and marijuana and tobacco lead to use of other substances?
        -   Leads to substance use prevention and early interventions.

## Why am I talking about this as a data scientists? üë©‚Äçüî¨

-   Through the entire stage of getting to know the data its important to consider having a deep understanding of all that came before it

-   Why?

    -   Because having a solid understanding of study design helps for a solid understanding of the *type* of data you *should* collect
        -   factor, numerical, ordinal, continuous, discrete
    -   It helps also in presenting you findings, through visualizations
    -   **Reproducibility**
        -   As researcher you should be building within your protocol methods in ensuring that yout work is transparent and reproducible.

to ensure that your work is reproducible you should use code! üë©‚Äçüíª

# A *(gentle)* introduction of how to interpret data using data science

## 1. Learn how to code

-   If you are doing something repetitive, using a programming language can help you automate your work (using functions)
-   Even if what you're doing isn't repetitive, using a programming language can help ensure that all the work you've done "cleaning" the data is documented.
-   With cod you are able to data exploring, cleaning data, visualizing data, model data and report your data in a manuscript all on the same document [(Rmarkdown/Quarto)](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)

## 2. Familiarize yourself with data basics

::: panel-tabset
### Database

-   Get to know where the data being housed (REDCap, Qualtrics Remote Server etc.)
    -   it's important to know where you're able to *pull* the data from, because then you're able get the data immediately on your computer. (e.g., [{tidyREDCap}](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/articles/useAPI.html))
    -   You are also able to build your own REDCap shells in which you can collect data from observations (e.g., [REDCap Resources](https://projectredcap.org/resources/videos/))

### EDA

-   Explore the data:
    -   What does my data look like
    -   what are the largest and smallest values in my data
    -   is this particular variable a "type in" form (e.g., string)
    -   do I need to *transform* certain variables?
    -   do we need to group certain categories?
    -   in this step you also incorporate a little bit of visualizations

### Compute

-   Consider the programming language you will untilize
    -   R, SAS, Python, Stata, SPSS ([R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) my personal favorite)
    -   Consider using multiple language tools
        -   being a polyglot in programming languages is a good thing! But it's good to also begin with one language first.
    -   Consider if your planning on publishing your findings through a manuscript or present these findings to an audience

### Model

-   Modeling your data:
    -   Consider the appropriate test to use for the type of data you have
        -   will you be running a t-test, linear regression, maybe a mixed effects model more appropriate?
    -   what type of questions were asked and what type of data do you have:
        -   is this data correlated?
        -   is this data nested?
        -   do you have repeated measures?

‚≠êÔ∏è important: you should consult with your team (PI, epidemoligist, and your Data Scientist) when asking these questions

### Visualize

-   Visualizing your data:
    -   what story do you want to convey to your audience?
        -   I think that science, especially if you are working with Community Based Research (CBR), should be accessible. Meaning, understandable to a wide audience. (doctors, people in health care, researchers, educators, and the community) so when conveying your findings, use plain english when appropriate.
            -   Do not do [*legalese*](https://bcs.mit.edu/news/even-lawyers-dont-legalese) ü§¢
    -   EDA and visualizing go hand-in-hand so consider building plots, graphs, visuals, and when it comes time to present findings.

## Databases

- REDCap: my favorite tool when it comes to managing data 

:::::: columns

-   There is a fantastic video by an Associate Professor at the University of Miami on building Redcap (what I consider the golden standard in data collection) to collect research data on HIV and substance abuse

## Exploratory Data Analysis

-   this part is *extremely* important, no matter what field you are in public health.
-   good practice to to ask yourself "what does my data even look like?"
-   a basic overview of the EDA process is:
    -   generating descriptive statistics üìä
    -   check to see if there are any outliers (boxplots)
    -   maybe see if there is any differences between groups:
        -   e.g., calculating the average lifespan between men and women after a colorectal diagnosis
    -   this process also may include "cleaning" your data up a bit.
    -   this process is dynamic, and should be incorporated in every step
    -   or maybe your curious of seeing the general trend in the relationship between planktonic larvae duration and temperature?
    -   or maybe you want to see the general mean response rate of a certain instrument:

[EDA with the tidyverse/Rstudio](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda)
:::

## Computing the data

-   Consider the type of programming language are you planning on using for your research project
    -   personally I like to set up a new project which is essentially dedicated folders storing the data, code, figures, outputs and scripts.

![](images/example-project-setup-01.png){fig-align="center" width="411"}

-   this method ensures i keep rigorous documentation of every step i handle the data. this method also allows me to: 
    - include all my calculations (including modeling) in my code/manuscript. 
    - maintain a tidy level of reproducability 
    - and R is also *free.* 
    - SAS is a wonderful and powerful tool, but if you do not have a membership outside the university setting it is hard to access.

![](images/quarto.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

## Visualizing the data

-   EDA process and creating visualizations go hand in hand. Remember, during your EDA, you are trying to investigate what your data is trying to tell you. It is important to become familiar with the data and asking the right questions such as
    -   how does the variation between variables look like
    -   what does my distribution look like?
-   when you understand or become familiar with the data you can visualize it to convey important messages to inform the public, and possibly leading the changes in policy, as well as drive decision making about the population.

### Visualization examples

## Modeling Data

check out the link below for developing good statistical practice when modeling with R.

-   if relationships exist between two variables, it may appear as pattern in your data (thats why EDA is important because it may give you hints about these patterns)
    -   ask yourself if these patterns are due:
        -   to random chance
        -   how are you able to describe the relationship that implies this pattern
        -   what variable might be affecting this relationship?

## *Bring it all together now üé∂*

-   Understand all these steps are vital points in interpreting your data:
    -   understand your project design helps you understand the goals and *aims* of your project. (prep)
    -   Exploring your data helps you understand the *story* your data is trying to tell you. (EDA)
    -   Visualizing your data helps you understand the *patterns* of your data. (visualize)
    -   Computing your data helps you understand the *distributions* of your data. (compute)
    -   Modeling your data helps you understand the *relationships* of your data. (model)

at each step, your making decisions about your data, and how you will interpret your findings.


## Currently in my work.. 

-   i've had to implement every aspect of what we just talked about including
    -   mutating or transforming the data

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)

starwars |> 
  select(name, mass, species) |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  mutate(mass_norm = mass / mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE))


```

-   categorizing or grouping

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true

mtcars |> 
  mutate(cg = case_when(
    carb <= 2 ~ "low",
    carb > 2 ~ "high"
  ))



```

-   transforming the shape of the data

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true


# turn wide data to long data for easier categorization
relig_income |> 
  pivot_longer(!religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count")




```

-   Visualizing the data

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true


library(igraphdata)
library(ggraph)
library(patchwork)
library(graphlayouts)
data("karate")



  ggraph(karate, layout = "focus", focus = 1) +
  draw_circle(use = "focus", max.circle = 3) +
  geom_edge_link0(edge_color = "black", edge_width = 0.3) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(Faction)), size = 2, shape = 21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#8B2323", "#EEAD0E")) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(title = " Ego Network UM1010")



   ggraph(karate, layout = "focus", focus = 34) +
  draw_circle(use = "focus", max.circle = 4) +
  geom_edge_link0(edge_color = "black", edge_width = 0.3) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = as.factor(Faction)), size = 2, shape = 21) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#8B2323", "#EEAD0E")) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(title = "Ego Network UM1034")



```

-   create functions to automate my work

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# create empty list for matched data
matching_data <- list()

# Loop through the CSV files
for (csv_file in csv_files) {
  # Extract record ID from the file name
  record_id <- gsub(".csv$", "", basename(csv_file))
  
  # Check if the record ID matches any pattern in filtered_data
  if (any(sapply(filtered_data$study_id, function(pattern) grepl(pattern, record_id)))) {
    # Read the CSV file
    csv_data <- read_csv(csv_file)
    
    # Add the matching data to the list
    matching_data[[length(matching_data) + 1]] <- csv_data
  }
}

# make new df with matched observations
combined_data <- bind_rows(matching_data)

# plyr:rbind works and add NA values to missing values
matching_data |> 
  plyr::rbind.fill() 



```

-   model my data

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# load tivverse
library(tidyverse)

# read in example data
PLD <- 
  read_table(here::here("data", "PLD.txt"))


```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true


# load modeling package
library(lme4)

# subset mollusca only
Mollusca_subset <- 
  PLD |> 
  filter(phylum == "Mollusca")

# creating log -transformed variables 
Mollusca_subset$log_pld <- log(Mollusca_subset$pld)
Mollusca_subset$log_temp <- log(Mollusca_subset$temp)

# mixed model with random intercept only 
RandIntModel_Mollusca <- lmer(log_pld ~ log_temp + (1 | species), data = Mollusca_subset)

# summary of model fit
summary(RandIntModel_Mollusca)



```

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
**interpretation of temp variable** for the fixed part, we can interpret this parameter the same as a single-level regression model, [so $\beta_1$ is the increase/decrease in response for 1 unit increase/decrease in $x.$]{style="background-color:yellow"} In other words, for one unit increase in the degrees of temperature, there is a -1.5 decrease in Planktonic larval duration. (or, as the temperature increase, the plankton duration is lower.)
